#### Long-Term Climate Stability Shapes FD and PD In Euro-Mediterranean Forests

The goal of this R project is to reproduce all analyses, figures, and
tables of drivers of FD and PD of Mediterranean forests (multidiversity
and muti taxon approach)🌳 Past climate stability, Present habitat
characteristics, Disturbances and Past and Present human impact.

## Content

The directory contains:

-   [:file_folder: R](/R): ⚙ Folder containing all functions
    created for the analyses. These functions can be loaded using
    **devtools::load_all()**. They are called in the scripts coded in
    the analysis folder.
    
-   [:file_folder: analysis](/analysis): 🍳 Folder containing all script to
    prepare data and analyse it. It uses the functions coded in the R
    folder.
    
-   [:file_folder: integradiv_db](/integradiv_db): 📦 Folder containing the data from the INTEGRADIV database. It more specifically contains:

    - traits data with all traits gathered in the INTEGRADIV database (only a subset were used in this paper - cf first analyses) _version from September 2024_
  
    - phylogenies (some of them being pruned in this paper - cf first analyses) _version from September 2024_
  
    - occurrences in 50*50km grid cells _version from September 2024_
  
    - spatial grid of the studied area
  
    - land mask of the studied area
  
-   [:file_folder: transformed_data](/transformed_data): Folder containing all intermediate dataframe/list/vector created during the analyses, and  used to get final outputs. Data has been transformed from the raw data  (INTEGRADIV database).

-   [:file_folder: outputs](/outputs): Folder containing all the outputs of the project, created in the analyses scripts. It also includes specific folders [:file_folder: residual_maps](/outputs/residual_maps) which contains maps the residuals from each random forest model, to visualize whether the model was better at predicting specific areas or not ; [:file_folder: drivers_maps](/outputs/drivers_maps) which contains maps of specific individual drivers ; [:file_folder: directionality](/outputs/directionality) which contains plots (biplots and mosaic plots) representing the directionality of the effect of individual drivers on each dimension of diversity and for each facet. Only the individual drivers having a relative importance > 75% were studied here.

-   make.R File: Script to run the whole project. Be careful, some steps might be time consuming, and have been run on a server.
